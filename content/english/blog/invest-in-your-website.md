In our experience, there are two types of people: business owners and entrepreneurs. One of the most common errors business owners make when it comes to websites is perceiving it as an expense rather than an investment.

But savvy entrepreneurs understand that allocating resources to their business equates to an investment, not a cost. The true value is gauged by the return on investment it delivers.

For instance, you hire a developer for £2,500 to create a static website for you. It may seem like a steep price. However, with an improved, well-performing site, you may convert visitors into customers who might otherwise have left your site due to slow load times or a dated design. This £2,500 could potentially bring in an additional £15,000 annually, or more, to your business.

Invest £2,500 within one year and get an extra £15,000 in return, wouldn't you want to "invest" more? While we are aware these figures may seem plucked out of thin air, they're not beyond the realms of possibility.

We've seen some clients doubling their business after working with us for a year. Our services related to website creation are available for £100 per month. We have a team of designers and developers who specialise in creating attractive, efficient static websites using modern technology, which are perfect for businesses that don't require frequent content updates.

Here's an analogy: a kitchen fitter that earns a minimum income of about £900 per new customer. If our website brings in one additional customer per month, that equates to an additional £800 in revenue each month. However, this is just one aspect of the value our website offers.

Besides, the monthly fee of £100 covers additional benefits such as excellent 24/7 support, site updates, responses to search algorithm changes, and answers to any queries that may arise.

The fee you pay isn't just for website use, but also for the support of partners who are invested in your business's success.

Building a website is akin to getting a tattoo; you get what you pay for. Opting for a cheap £500 website from Fiverr might result in something generic or outdated that actually repels potential customers.

Finding a reputable web developer is like hunting for a renowned tattoo artist. You do your research, find someone who can answer your questions and create an impressive and high-quality design.

Despite the cheap and quick options available for website creation, it's crucial to realise a great website won't come at those prices.

You wouldn't trust a doctor you found online for £1000 to perform surgery compared to other practitioners charging £10,000.

Businesses that aim for a quality website and sustainable growth should consider selecting a developer with expertise and experience in creating a standardised website. It may take time and effort to build a high-quality website, but it will yield desirable results and fully meet customer needs.

Those seeking a cheap website developer should anticipate results that correspond to the quoted price. However, those desiring a precise, high-quality website should choose services from developers with proven knowledge and skill. Experienced developers might come with a higher price tag, but they will deliver satisfaction and value to your business in the long run.
