### Speed's Impact on Google Ranking

One of the significant factors that influence your website's ranking on Google is how quickly it loads and executes - particularly on mobile devices.

### The Slow-Loading Issue of Dynamic Websites

Dynamic websites like WordPress and Wix are often prone to slower loading issues. This slow speed primarily stems from the server's need to access the database. Additionally, an increased number of plugins and additions to your website often result in slower loading times.

Research indicates that most users abandon a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. Hence, if your website exceeds this threshold, it proves counterproductive as users are likely to leave before they fully access your site. This slow-loading factor is a common drawback associated with WordPress and Wix sites, leading to lost traffic and, ultimately, revenue.

### The Fast-Loading Advantage of Static Websites

Static websites offer the benefit of being ten times faster than their dynamic counterparts. They don't need to assemble webpage fragments rapidly as everything required is pre-built. The system's only task is to load the webpage in the browser for display.

Static websites don't require additional plugins, databases, unnecessary space consumption, or upscaling. Every line of code written on the website has a purpose and is written in an organized fashion. This streamlined structure makes it easier for Google to read and understand the site's content.

### The "Spaghetti Code" Problem in Dynamic Websites

Dynamic websites, especially WordPress ones, involve a lot of complex and redundant code, resulting in significantly slower loading times. Consider the analogy of a plate of spaghetti - if it is tangled and pieced together, it takes much longer to distinguish and count how many strands there are.

On the other hand, consider a different plate (representing your static site) where the spaghetti is neatly arranged and ready to eat. When everything is grouped orderly, it's quicker and easier to analyze the strands. This analogy demonstrates the coding style difference between dynamic and static sites, known as "spaghetti code". This tangled coding structure makes loading websites a more time-consuming process for browsers and Google's search engines to understand and load your website's content.

### Speed Benchmark of Static Websites

The benchmark load time for websites is 2 seconds, but static websites that we hand-code consistently load under 0.5 seconds, significantly below the website benchmark average.

Static websites load instantly, with the code grouped and organized for easy reading and understanding by browsers and Google. This organization improves load times, prevents customers from leaving your website prematurely, and enhances your website's ranking on Google.

### The Importance of Checking Website Load Times

If your website isn't generating as much business as you'd like, it's worth examining how long it takes to load. Using Google's tools, if your website's load time exceeds 3 seconds, the likelihood of people leaving before they reach your site is high.

Google has recently updated its algorithm to prioritize the speed and performance of websites on mobile devices, known as Mobile First Indexing. Sites that perform well under this algorithm will rank higher. This is where static websites tend to excel as they generally load quickly and perform well, improving your website's overall ranking.
