### Vulnerability of Dynamic Websites

Dynamic websites, which use databases and server-side platforms, can potentially be targets for attacks when accessing the database or a content management system that stores all your website data. As the server prepares the website for the browser, hackers can exploit this process and infiltrate your website.

### Security of Static Websites

In contrast, static websites provide no points of attack. They have no databases, session tokens, or information transmissions that could offer hackers a chance to intervene or intercept. Static websites lack the processes where hackers could potentially sneak in and insert something harmful in the back-end of your website on its way to the browser.

### Challenges with WordPress Sites

WordPress sites often encounter challenges with their necessary plugins. If these are not updated regularly, they may need to be refreshed to fix security vulnerabilities. If neglected, your site could become susceptible to malicious attacks. Additionally, outdated plugins might cause compatibility issues with other users, damaging your site unexpectedly.

### Maintenance of Static Websites

Maintaining and updating static websites are far less demanding as they consist solely of HTML and CSS. Once completed, no additional security patches are required. Teams can focus on monitoring and updating these websites, which is an effective strategy for maintaining long-term site security and integrity.

### Targeting of WordPress Sites by Hackers

Being the most popular content management system (CMS) for website building, WordPress sites are particularly targeted by hackers seeking to exploit known vulnerabilities. Outdated versions and plugins can make your website an easy target.

By choosing a static website, this target is removed, and your website can exist independently, free from the concern of being snatched from the internet.

### The Advantage of Static Websites on CDNs

Lastly, the servers hosting static websites aren't compromised and can't take down the site. When a static website is served by a content delivery network (CDN), your site exists on multiple servers globally, always available for access. If one server goes down, the site can be loaded from another server in a different location, eliminating any potential downtime!
