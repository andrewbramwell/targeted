Platforms such as Wix and WordPress offer free website building facilities. They provide the ability to create a website effortlessly and swiftly, often appealing to small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on a tight budget that can't afford specialised developers.

However, while these tools present an intriguing alternative, they come with limitations, especially when considering page loading speed, security, customer conversions, and Google rankings.

For instance, if you aim to create a static website with hand-coding for optimum loading speed, enhanced security, improved customer conversions, and favourable Google ranking, you might want to consider a specialised web development company.

The decision between building a website yourself and hiring a web developer often hinges on your specific needs and available resources.

#### Here are some reasons why hiring a professional may be beneficial:

* **Expertise:** Having experts with knowledge and experience in website building could help you achieve better results. They can design and develop a website that suits your needs.

* **Customisation and Flexibility:** A skilled developer could customise and adapt your website to meet your specific needs, providing advice to enhance your website's capabilities.

* **Optimisation and Speed:** Developers proficient with the right tools and techniques can build efficient, fast-loading websites. This results in a better browsing experience and increased customer satisfaction.

* **Security:** Employing a developer specialising in website security can reduce the risk of hacking or cyber-attacks.

* **Time and Resources:** Building a website yourself can consume more time and resources than expected. If you have other critical tasks like business management or marketing, a web developer could free up your time.

Consider this analogy: Anyone can buy paint and attempt to paint their own house, but the results may not match those delivered by a professional painter. The same applies to website development. Using a free platform may be a viable option for some, but the process involves complex knowledge and coding expertise to meet both business and customer needs.

Professional developers often deliver websites with faster loading speeds, more robust security systems, better customer attraction, and higher chances of achieving favourable search engine rankings.

Static websites created by specialised developers can cost anything between £2,000 and £10,000, depending on the complexity. It's understandable why free platform builders can be appealing.

However, if you're aiming to elevate your business, cease missing out on monetising opportunities, and consider creating a static website that outperforms and is more appreciated than your competitors. There are developers who build custom WordPress websites that function effectively and demonstrate a commitment to their craft.

If your website needs a database and dynamically creates multiple pages based on visitor preferences, WordPress is ideal.

We're not trying to discredit WordPress or its developers. WordPress remains a valid and useful alternative for those who want to edit their own content, create an online store, write editable articles, custom applications, or manage data.

A static website is a suitable option for sites that only need to display information without storing or manipulating data or creating new content for each visitor.

Using WordPress to create a strictly informational website could be overkill, and the odds are high that your competitors have a WordPress site too.

While some software developers or agencies may charge a premium to create a stable, easy-to-navigate WordPress website, these sites are sometimes just templates used to present and transfer data without support.

Finding professional, skilled developers or agencies can be a challenge. It's essential to consider the value for the cost and invest time in selecting the right partner.
